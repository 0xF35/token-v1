## Agreement Before Continuing
- **Client-Side Functionality**: Token operates fully on the client side. It uses the information you provide to generate a token through cryptographic calculations, encrypts the token, and stores it locally in your browser. You must use the same master password for both encryption and decryption of the token.
- **User Responsibility**: It is your responsibility to remember the information provided during token generation (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Secret) and the platform name or URL. If you forget any of these, there is no way to recover your token or password.
- **Secret Information**: The "Secret" can be any unique, permanent information that you can easily recall, such as a Social Security Number or any other identifier that is personal and memorable to you.
- **No Recovery Option**: Token has no recovery mechanism for forgotten tokens or information. You bear full responsibility for remembering all inputs provided during token generation.
