# 🔒[Token v1](https://token-v1.vercel.app/) - The Only Password Manager You’ll Ever Need

> Why trust your passwords to someone else when you can take control yourself?

**Token v1** isn’t your typical password manager. No subscription fees, no sketchy cloud storage, no “we swear we’re secure” promises. You hold the keys – literally. This tool generates cryptographically strong passwords on the client side, securely hashed using SHA512 and SHAKE256, stored only in your local storage. Why? Because no one, not even us, should have access to your secrets.

## 💀 Stop Trusting Cloud-Based Password Managers
Cloud-based password managers say they’re encrypted, but who knows what’s happening behind the scenes? Hacks happen, data leaks happen, and your passwords get sold on the dark web.

With **Token v1**, everything happens locally on your machine. No servers, no cloud, no BS. You want control? You got it.

## 👨‍💻 How It Works (or, why this is better than anything you've ever used)
- **SHA512 and SHAKE256 Hashing** : *Industry-standard cryptographic algorithms that haven’t been broken yet (and probably never will be).*
- **XOR-based Token Encryption** : *A strong yet efficient method to encrypt your token with your password. Take that, weak XOR haters.*
- **Client-side Password Generation** : *No one ever touches your passwords except you. Your platform and master password generate cryptographically strong passwords that are secure by design.*
- **No Cloud** : *Your passwords aren’t floating around in some random data center waiting to be stolen. Everything stays on your machine.*
- **Completely Offline** : *You don’t even need the internet to use Token v1. True privacy.*

## 🚀 Quickstart
visit [Token v1](https://token-v1.vercel.app/)

That’s it. No need to overcomplicate things.

## 🤬 Who Needs This?
- Paranoid developers who trust no one.
- People tired of bloated password managers that pretend to be free and then charge you after 3 passwords.
- Security enthusiasts who know that online password managers are ticking time bombs.

## ❌ Don’t Use This If…
- You’re cool with handing over your most sensitive info to Big Tech™.
- You like overpriced subscription services that store your passwords on their servers.
- You believe cloud-based services are “unhackable” (LOL).

## 🔧 Features
- Fast Password Generation – SHA512 and SHAKE256 hashing, because speed matters.
- Secure Local Storage – Your encrypted token is stored locally, so only you have access.
- Minimal UI – Focus on security, not shiny buttons.
- No Ads, No Subscriptions – Your security isn’t for sale.

## 🔒 Master Password Security
Here’s the twist: it only store the first 4 characters of your master password locally for verification
> —just the first four out of a robust 128-character password hash.

Why, you ask? Because it’s about playing the odds. Those four characters serve as your gatekeepers, while the remaining 124 are yours to keep secret. Good luck cracking that! This approach raises eyebrows, but it combines efficiency with a formidable layer of security. Your passwords remain out of reach, locked behind unmatched hashing and cryptography.

## 🛠️ Development
1. Clone the repo
2. Mess around with the JavaScript. Try breaking it – good luck.
3. Submit a pull request or fork it for your secret hacker club.

## 🤝 Contributing
Don’t be a script kiddie. Read the code, improve it, open a PR, and maybe I’ll let it through. We value contributions from people who understand real security, not flashy UIs or useless features.

## 👀 Disclaimer
This project isn’t responsible if you forget your master password or if you screw something up. Your security is your responsibility. If you lose your token, you lose your passwords. Simple.
